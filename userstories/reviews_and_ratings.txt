User Story D2: Viewing Restaurant Reviews
=============================================
As a user, 
I want to see Google reviews and ratings for restaurants
so that I can make informed decisions.

Story Card:
---------------------------------------------
First, you scroll through the restaurant's information pop-up until you hit "Reviews"
Next, you will see the top Google reviews for the restaurant, including the rating that is associated with each review.
Finally, once you hit the end of the presented reviews, you will have the option to view more reviews.

Task Card: Viewing Reviews
---------------------------------------------
The information pop-up will display a variety of information for the user. Reviews will be after "cuisine type".
Using the scroll wheel or arrow keys, the user can scroll through the top 3-5 reviews from Google and see the associated information (reviewer, ratings, etc.)
At the end of the scroll menu, the user can click the "view more" button to load in additional reviews from Google's database until there are none left.
The user will also have the option to return to the top of the reviews through a "return to top" button that is next to "view more".
